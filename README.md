# kicad-parts-stock-board

Sets of parts, from the "BASIC" JLCPCB collection. Order PCBA with a set of parts - it's convenient and compact.

To reduce the price, you must order a set with a minimum assortment of components.

# Who needs it?

Storing components on a single board is convenient for repair engineers. You are less interrupted looking for a component - everything on one board is in your field of vision.
